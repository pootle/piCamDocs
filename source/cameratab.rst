Camera tab
==========

The camera tab shows the controls available for the camera.

camera resolution
    The resolution used when opening the camera. This defaults to 1/2 the size of the camera's full resolution.
    This reduces the overall load, but still gives the full field of view of the camera. Various other resolutions
    are available, these vary depending on the camera version. Changes to resolution only take effect if the camera
    is completed stopped (i.e. before first use or when the camera is restarted)

frame rate in fps
    This sets the frame rate the camera runs at. Note that this also limits the exposure time, so for viewing in low light,
    the frame rate must be reduced. This parameter accepts values down to .1, which means 1 frame every 10 seconds. This 
    allows the camera to use an exposure time of up to 10 seconds (for V2 cameras). Note that for longer exposures.'exposure mode'
    should be set to 'night' As with camera resolution, any changes while the camera is running will not take effect until the
    camera is restarted.

rotation
    allows the camera output to be rotated in 90 degree increments to compensate for the camera installation being on its side or upside
    down. Changes are immediate.

brightness
    Allows the camera's brightness atribute to be dynamically updated. It usually takes a few frames for any change to stabilise.

contrast
    Allows the camera's contrast attibute to be dynamically updates. It usually takes a few frames for any change to stabilise.

awb mode
    Allows the camera's automatic white balance to be dynamically updated. It usually takes a few frames for any change to stabilise.

exposure mode
    Allows the camera's automatic exposure mode to be dynamically updated. It usually takes a few frames for any change to stabilise.

exposure adjust
    Provides an exposure compensation adjustment to be dynamically updated. This works in the same way as the camera's attribute and allows
    adjustment in 1/6th stop increments over a range of + / - 4 stops, although the entire range is not usually effective.
