tripped video
=============

The tripped video tab controls and enables video recordings to be triggered by other activities. So far this means cpu based movement 
detection or using external hardware that can interface with a gpio input pin.

It allows a few seconds of video from before the trigger to be combined with video that runs until several seconds after the last trigger
occurs.

It works by continuously recording to a circular buffer, and when triggered, it switches recording to a temporary file, and saves (part of)
the circular buffer to another temprary file, and finishes by using MP4Box to merge the 2 files into an mp4 file.

triped video fields
-------------------

state
    Shows the current state of this stream. See :ref:`state field for details <common-field-state>`.

stream resolution
    The feed from the camera (which can be of much higher resolution) is scaled to this size. 
    See :ref:`stream resolution field for details <common-field-stream-res>`.

pre-trigger record time
    This is the number of seconds from before the trigger happens to use at the start of the video. The time is approximate and can vary, expecially
    at low frame rates.

post trigger record time
    The video keeps running until this number of seconds after the last trigger time.
